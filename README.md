# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations. The provided `bug.dart` file showcases code that only prints errors to the console instead of handling them gracefully.  The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling.  Simply printing an error message is inadequate in production;  users should receive informative error messages and the application should recover gracefully or provide a fallback mechanism.

## Solution

The solution incorporates several improvements:

1. **Specific Error Handling:** Instead of a generic `catch (e)`, the improved code handles specific exceptions where possible (e.g., handling HTTP status codes).
2. **Informative Error Messages:**  Error messages provide more context, aiding debugging and user understanding.
3. **Rethrowing or Returning Errors:**  The code considers either rethrowing the exception (allowing higher-level handling) or returning an error value to indicate failure.
4. **Proper JSON Decoding:** Includes more robust JSON response handling and checks for potential decoding issues.
